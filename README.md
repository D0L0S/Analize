# Analize
Quickly and easily create charts from analytics data. Analize pulls browser statistics from Google Analytics then generates pie charts for the last month and a line chart for the last 6 months. 
Once graphs are created they are emailed to all users listed within the sqlite3 database.

# Reason
This project was built to solve the repetative task of gathering monthly statistics and sending them to the relavent team members.
